### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹
My name is David and I like to break things and then make them work again... <br>
I recently graduated from Pennsylvania Highlands Community College and am looking to make some sort of change in the world with the new knowledge I've acquired..

Besides that, I do stuff with Python to make things happen
